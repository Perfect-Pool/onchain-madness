Add natspec comments describing what each function does (if doesn't exist), its arguments and returns. If exists, improve it if is needed

Follow the default type of comment below:
```
/**
 * @dev Returns the status of a game
 * @param gameIndex The index of the game
 * @return status The status of the game
 */
```

Also add a natspec comment for the beggining of the file (if doesn't exist), describing what this contract does in general. If exists, improve it if is needed

Folow the sample:
```
/**
 * @title BracketGame8
 * @author PerfectPool
 * @notice General description, well detailed
 */
```
